# What's `spin`?
Spin is a wrapper script that dramatically improves the developer experience when working with Docker. Spin uses officially supported features and best practices from Docker. It takes 70 character commands and simplifies them down to 7 characters.

## Features
- ✅ Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux (using Docker)
- ✅ Language independent (works with PHP, Node, Ruby, Python, etc)
- ✅ Install as project dependency or to your system
- ✅ Follows the Docker standards. If you can do it in Docker, you can do it with Spin

# Comparisons
### Vagrant
* Vagrant is very bloated
* You shouldn't run Vagrant in production

### Laravel Sail
We love Laravel Sail, but it focuses specifically on Development environments only. Sail uses Docker as well, but it's not something that is built to production servers.

You should consider `spin` over Laravel sail if:
- You want your development environment to be a 100% match of your production environment
- You want to use Spin for projects other than PHP or Laravel

### Kubernetes
Kubernetes is great, but over complicated for most apps. If you need [99.9999% uptime](https://uptime.is/99.9999) (and it makes business sense to pay the price for an uptime like that), then Kubernetes might be a great fit for you.

# Installation

## Download Docker Desktop
You need a working `docker` command on your machine. Best place to get this is downloading and installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Install `spin`
There are multiple options:

### Install as project dependency
Instructions coming soon.

### Install as a system tool
Instructions coming soon.
