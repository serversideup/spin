# Updating Your Server
::lead-p
Keeping your server up to date is important for security and performance. Spin makes it stupid-easy to update your server.
::

## Background
Running an out of date server stack can lead to security vulnerabilities and performance issues. Spin makes it easy to keep your server up to date. There are two categories of updates:

- Application Stack Updates
- Server Updates

`spin maintain` focuses on *server updates*. Here's a quick look at what that looks like:

### Application Stack Updates
What we mean by application stack updates are things like Redis, Postgres, Node, PHP, etc. These are things you'll want to look at in your `docker-compose.*.yml`, `composer.json`, `package.json`, etc. Whenever you make a change, it will be version controlled so you can easily test and revert if needed.

### Server Updates
Server updates are things like the underlying operating system, Docker, etc. It's important to keep these packages up to date as well. Thankfully Spin includes the [`spin maintain`](/docs/command-reference/maintain) command which will take care of the heavy lifting for you.

::note
When you perform maintenance on your server, your server may experience brief downtime if it the updates require a reboot. Be sure to run this command during a communicated maintenance window.

The above command will:

- Connect to your server(s)
- Update the all operating system packages
- Update Docker
- Reboot the server (if needed)
