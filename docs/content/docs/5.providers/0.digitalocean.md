# Create a Server with DigitalOcean
::lead-p
DigitalOcean is one of the most popular cloud VPS providers in the development community. Many tools and services are built to support it.
::

## Create an account
The first step is to create an account with DigitalOcean. You can do this by going to their website and clicking the "Sign Up" button. With the link below, they offer $200 in credits. This is an affiliate link, meaning we get a small kickback if you sign up, but this doesn't affect our recommendations.

## Create an API token
::note
This API token is very powerful and should be treated as a secret. Do not share this token and treat it like you would a password.
::

To create an API token, you'll need to sign in to the [DigitalOcean Console](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/). On the left sidebar, click on the "API" section.

![Go to DigitalOcean API](/images/docs/digitalocean/api-sidebar.png)

On the API page, click the "Generate New Token" button.

![Generate DigitalOcean API Token](/images/docs/digitalocean/generate-token.png)

You can set a number of settings for the token:

- **Name**: Set this to something descriptive.
- **Expiration**: Set how long the token should be valid for. The shorter the value, the more secure, but the more often you'll need to generate a new token.
- **Scopes**: Select "Custom Scopes" for the most secure option.

![DigitalOcean API Token Scopes](/images/docs/digitalocean/token-scopes.png)

If you choose "Custom Scopes", you can select the following permissions:

::note
The "Full Access" scope is the easiest option, but it gives the token access to everything. Choose what makes the most sense for your use case. Use the custom scopes below for the most secure option.
::

| Access Level | Scopes | Details |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Fully Scoped Access | 10 scopes | - firewall (4): create, read, update, delete<br>- regions (1): read<br>- sizes (1): read<br>- ssh_key (4): create, read, update, delete |
| Create Access | 4 scopes | project / tag / image / droplet |
| Read Access | 5 scopes | snapshot / project / tag / image / droplet |
| Update Access | 3 scopes | project / image / droplet |
| **Total Custom Scopes** | **22 scopes** | |


## Place the token in your `.spin.yml` file
In your `.spin.yml` file, you'll find a `providers` section where you can add your DigitalOcean API token.

::code-panel
---
label: .spin.yml configure providers
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# 👇 Providers - You must set at least one provider
##############################################################

providers:
  - name: digitalocean
    api_token: abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz
```
::

## Set as DO_API_TOKEN environment variable
If you prefer to set the token as an environment variable, you can also set the `DO_API_TOKEN` variable in your `.env` file, secrets manager, or wherever you store your environment variables.

## Configure users
Make sure you configure your system users in your `.spin.yml` file.

[Learn more about users →](/docs/server-configuration/spin-yml-usage#users)

::code-panel
---
label: Example users configuration in .spin.yml
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# 👇 Users - You must set at least one user
##############################################################

users:
  - username: alice
    name: Alice Smith
    groups: ['sudo']
    authorized_keys:
      - public_key: "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lmyfakeublickeyMVIzwQXBzxxD9b8Erd1FKVvu alice"
```

## Configuring a DigitalOcean hardware profile
By default we set you up with a very cost-effective hardware profile to get up and running quickly.

::code-panel
---
label: .spin.yml default Hardware Profiles
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# 🤖 Hardware Profiles
##############################################################

hardware_profiles:
  # DigitalOcean
  - name: digitalocean_1c_1gb_ubuntu2404
    provider: digitalocean
    profile_config:
      region: nyc3
      size: s-1vcpu-1gb
      image: ubuntu-24-04-x64
      backups: true
```
::

You can uncomment the defaults we give you or create/modify your own hardware profile.

::code-panel
---
label: Example server configuration in .spin.yml
---
```yaml
##############################################################
# 👇 Servers - You must set at least one server
##############################################################

servers:
  - server_name: ubuntu-1gb-nyc-1
    environment: production
    hardware_profile: digitalocean_1c_1gb_ubuntu2404
```

## Provision your server
Once you have everything ready, you can provision your server(s) by running this simple command:

::code-panel
---
label: Provision your server(s)
---
```bash
spin provision
```
::

This command will create your server(s) with DigitalOcean and configure your server(s) to be ready for deployment. There are many more options available when provisioning your server(s). To learn more see the guide below:

## Getting ready for deployment
Now that you have a server ready, you'll want to learn how to get ready for deployment. Next steps are to choose a deployment strategy.
