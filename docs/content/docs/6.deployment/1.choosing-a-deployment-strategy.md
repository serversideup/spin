# Choosing a Deployment Strategy
::lead-p
Spin supports automated deployments and very simple deployments from your local machine. You can choose between these two strategies depending on your needs.
::

## Types of Deployments
There are two types of deployments:

1. **Simple Deployments from your local machine** - We can use the [`spin deploy`](/docs/command-reference/deploy) command to deploy your application from your local machine to your server.
2. **Automated Deployments** - You can use our GitHub Actions to help you automatically deploy your application when you push to GitHub.

|                         | spin deploy          | GitHub Actions |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Difficulty | Very Easy | Basic Understanding of SSH & GitHub Actions required |
| Team Size | Solo-developers | Small to very large teams |
| Zero-downtime Deployments | ✅ | ✅ |
| Automated Deployments | ❌ | ✅ |

Automated deployments are recommended for teams because they standardize the deployment process without human interaction. If you're a solo developer, you may find that [`spin deploy`](/docs/command-reference/deploy) is so easy to use you'll never need to learn the complexities of CI/CD or GitHub Actions.
