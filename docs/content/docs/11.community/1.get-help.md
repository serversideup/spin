# Get Help
::lead-p
We're huge believers the product is only as good as the community that supports it. We're here to help you get the most out of Spin.
::

## Ensure you're on the latest version
We're always shipping new features and bug fixes for Spin. Ensure you're on the latest release by checking the [releases page](https://github.com/serversideup/spin/releases).

You can also run `spin update` to ensure you're on the latest version.

If you're still having issues, sometimes deleting Spin and reinstalling might be a quick fix because it's so easy to delete and reinstall.

## Debugging
If you think you've found a bug in Spin, you can get debug logs by setting the `SPIN_DEBUG` environment variable to `true` before running any commands.

::code-panel
---
label: Set SPIN_DEBUG to true
---
```bash
SPIN_DEBUG=true spin version
```
::

This will show you exactly what Spin is running and these debug logs can help the community help you faster.

## Going back to the stable release
Going back to the stable release is as easy as deleting the `~/.spin` directory then following the installation instructions to reinstall Spin.

::code-panel
---
label: Delete Spin and reinstall
---
```bash
rm -rf ~/.spin
```
::

Now follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

- [Install to macOS](/docs/installation/install-macos)
- [Install to Linux](/docs/installation/install-linux)
- [Install to Windows](/docs/installation/install-windows)
