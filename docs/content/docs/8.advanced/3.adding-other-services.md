# Add Other Services to Your Project
::lead-p
Since Spin is based off of Docker Compose and Docker Swarm Mode, the possibilities are endless when it comes to expanding your infrastructure with Spin.
::

## Important Notes
Every infrastructure configuration is unique and you should always prioritize security when applying configurations. Be sure to encrypt secrets where possible, but for demonstration purposes we will show you examples in plain text.

We make a few assumptions in our examples below:
- Your development network is called `development` and properly created in your Docker Compose file
- You have the proper configurations made available in your `.infrastructure` folder with the `.gitignore` properly configured

## MariaDB

::code-panel

## MySQL

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  mysql: 
    image: mysql:8.4
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.dev.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  mysql:
    networks:
      - development
    volumes:
      - ./.infrastructure/volume_data/mysql/database_data/:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "rootpassword"
        MYSQL_DATABASE: "laravel"
        MYSQL_USER: "mysqluser"
        MYSQL_PASSWORD: "mysqlpassword"
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"

networks:
  development:
```
::

## Node

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  node:
    image: node:20
    working_dir: /usr/src/app

```
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.dev.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  node:
    command: "yarn dev"
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app:cached
    networks: 
      - development
    ports:
      - 3000:3000 # Remove the ports if you are using something like Trafeik or Caddy (recommended)

networks:
  development:
```
::

#### Commands 
You can see the "command:" calls to run `yarn dev`. This may need to be changed, depending on your project (and if you are using npm or yarn). Feel free to remove this command if you prefer to run the commands manually.

#### Using with Traefik
The example above directly exposes the Node server on port 3000. You'll likely never do that in production. If you use something like Traefik, you would replace the ports with labels, like this:

::code-panel
---
label: "Node Traefik Labels Example"
---
```yml
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.mynodeapp.rule=Host(`mynodeapp.dev.test`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.mynodeapp.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.mynodeapp.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.mynodeapp.loadbalancer.server.port=3000"
      - "traefik.http.services.mynodeapp.loadbalancer.server.scheme=http"
```
::

The `label` adds certain metadata to your container, telling Traefik to route "mynodeapp.dev.test" to port 3000 on your node container. All web traffic will enter through Traefik first, then to your Node container -- which is a more realistic scenario to what you can run in production.

## PHP
We use our open source PHP Docker Images, which are based on the official PHP images, but production-ready by default and optimized for Laravel out of the box. Read our guide on [selecting the right image variation](https://serversideup.net/open-source/docker-php/docs/guide/choosing-the-right-image) for your project.

::note
Notice how this project is using `build` instead of just calling an image directly. See the `Dockerfile` example why we do this.
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  php:
    build:
      context: . # Look for Dockerfile in the project root
      target: base
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.dev.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  php:
    build:
      # Notice how our build calls the "development" target.
      # See the Dockerfile for more details
      target: development
      args:
        # Spin loads the UID and GID to match the host in development
        # This is how we fix permission errors in development
        USER_ID: ${SPIN_USER_ID}
        GROUP_ID: ${SPIN_GROUP_ID}
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html/
    ports:
      - 80:80 # Remove the "ports" section if using Traefik or Caddy (recommended)
    networks:
      - development

networks:
  development:
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: Dockerfile"
---
```dockerfile
# Learn more about the Server Side Up PHP Docker Images at:
# https://serversideup.net/open-source/docker-php/

FROM serversideup/php:8.3-fpm-nginx AS base

FROM base AS development

# Fix permission issues in development by setting the "www-data"
# user to the same user and group that is running docker.
ARG USER_ID
ARG GROUP_ID
RUN docker-php-serversideup-set-id www-data ${USER_ID} ${GROUP_ID}

FROM base AS deploy
COPY --chown=www-data:www-data . /var/www/html
```
::

#### Using with Traefik
The compose.yaml examples above exposes the HTTP server on port 80. If you use something like Traefik, you would replace the ports with labels, like this:

::code-panel
---
label: "Laravel Traefik Labels Example"
---
```yml
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.laravel.rule=HostRegexp(`laravel.dev.test`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.laravel.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.services.laravel.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
      - "traefik.http.services.laravel.loadbalancer.server.scheme=http"
```
::

## Redis

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7.2
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.dev.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  redis:
    command: "redis-server --appendonly yes --requirepass mysupersecretredispassword"
    volumes:
      - ./.infrastructure/volume_data/redis/data:/data
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    networks:
      - development

networks:
  development:
```
::

## Soketi
See the [Soketi documentation](https://docs.soketi.app/getting-started/installation/docker) for selecting the correct version.
::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  socket:
    image: quay.io/soketi/soketi:1.6-16
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.dev.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  socket:
    environment:
      DEBUG: '1'
      DB_REDIS_HOST: "redis"
      DB_REDIS_PASSWORD: "redispassword"
      DB_REDIS_KEY_PREFIX: "socketi"
    networks: 
      - development
networks:
  development:
```

#### Using with Traefik
The compose.yaml examples above exposes the HTTP server on port 80. If you use something like Traefik, you would replace the ports with labels, like this:

::code-panel
---
label: "Laravel Traefik Labels Example"
---
```yml
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.soketi.rule=HostRegexp(`soketi.dev.test`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.soketi.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.soketi.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.soketi.loadbalancer.server.port=6001"
      - "traefik.http.services.soketi.loadbalancer.server.scheme=http"
```
::

## Traefik
Traefik is a reverse proxy and is great for terminating SSL for any service that supports HTTP/HTTPS. Since Traefik is such an important service, there can be a little more configuration in order to get it to function well.

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.yaml"
---
```yml
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v3.1
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: compose.dev.yaml"
---
```yml
  traefik:
    networks:
      development:
        aliases:
          - myapp.dev.test
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      # Add Docker as a mounted volume, so that Traefik can read the labels of other services
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./.infrastructure/conf/traefik/dev/traefik.yml:/traefik.yml:ro
      - ./.infrastructure/conf/traefik/dev/traefik-certs.yml:/traefik-certs.yml
      - ./.infrastructure/conf/traefik/dev/certificates/:/certificates
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: Development configuration at `./.infrastructure/conf/traefik/dev/traefik.yml`"
---
```yml
# Allow self-signed certificates

```
::

::code-panel
---
label: "Example: Development configuration at `./.infrastructure/conf/traefik/dev/traefik-certs.yml`"
---
```yml

      keyFile: /certificates/local-dev-key.pem
      stores:
        - default
```

#### Trusting self-signed certificates
If you use `spin init` or `spin new` to create your project, we ship a `local-dev` keypair. This is signed by the Server Side Up Certificate Authority. If you'd like to trust this CA, you need to install the CA Root on your machine (only do this if you trust our process): [https://serversideup.net/ca/](https://serversideup.net/ca/).
