::lead-p
Spin is able to run on any Linux machine that supports Docker. Getting started is as simple as installing Docker, then running a single command to install `spin`.
::

## Prerequisites
You must have a working installation of Docker.

::note
Most Docker documentation will push you to install "Docker Desktop" on your Linux machine. This is completely unnecessary in our opinion. Instead of "Docker Desktop", we suggest installing the "Docker Engine" instead.
::

### Install Docker Engine

Install "Docker Engine" following the official installation instructions:
- [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/){target="_blank"}
- [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/){target="_blank"} (NOT for Ubuntu. Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/){target="_blank"} for Ubuntu)
- [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/){target="_blank"}
- [RHEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/){target="_blank"}
- [SLES](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/sles/){target="_blank"}
- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/){target="_blank"}
- [Raspbian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/raspberry-pi-os/){target="_blank"}
- [Binaries](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/){target="_blank"}

### Configure Docker permissions
Using the [post-installation instructions defined by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/){target="_blank"}, be sure to add your current user to the `docker` group if you want to be able to run Docker without root privileges.

```bash [Create the "docker" group]
sudo groupadd docker
```

```bash [Add your current user to the "docker" group.]
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

```bash [Activate the changes to groups.]
newgrp docker
```

### Ensure Docker is working
To test you have a working version of Docker, you can run their "hello world" container. `docker version`.

```bash [Run a "hello world" container to ensure Docker works correctly]
docker run hello-world
```

### Check your Docker Compose Version
Spin is set to run the latest version of Docker Compose (Version 2).


```bash [Check your Docker Compose version]
docker compose version
```

If you do not see version 2.x installed, you'll need to update. [ How to Install Docker Compose V2 →](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#install-on-linux){target="_blank"}


## Download and install `spin`
Run the installer with this simple command in your terminal

```bash [Install Spin (no root permissions required)]
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/spin/main/tools/install.sh)"
```

The above script will install spin at the _user_ level in `~/.spin`, using less than 300KB of storage.

::note
Spin will prompt you if you want Spin to modify your PATH variable. If you press "Yes" follow the instructions on the screen. If you press "No" you will need to manually add Spin to your PATH.
::


## Configuring your PATH variable manually
If you did not add `spin` to your PATH during the installation, you can manually add it to your PATH by adding this to your shell profile:

::note
Run `echo $0` in your terminal to figure out which shell you are using.
::

```bash [Add spin to your path]
# Add this to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`
export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"
```

In order to apply the changes to your current terminal session, you will need to run the `source` command.

```bash [Use the "source" command to apply your profile changes immediately]
# If you're using ZSH
source ~/.zshrc

# If you're using Bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Validate it's working
You should be able to run this and get a result 🥳

```bash [Confirm spin is working correctly by getting the version]
spin version
```
