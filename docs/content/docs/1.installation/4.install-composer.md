# Install via Composer
::lead-p
Spin can be installed using Composer, a popular PHP package manager. This enables you to make Spin accessible without other developers doing any steps on their end.
::

## Add `spin` to your project with Composer
Installing `spin` at the project level is a great way to deploy `spin` without much configuration from the user's end. [View `spin` on Packagist →](https://packagist.org/packages/serversideup/spin)

We can use Docker to run `composer` and install it on your project. **Run this command from the parent folder of your project.**

::code-panel
---
label: Install `spin` with Composer
---
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app composer require serversideup/spin --dev
```
::

## Spin is installed 🥳
You should now be able to access `spin` by running:

::code-panel
---
label: Confirm Spin is working
---
```bash
bash vendor/bin/spin version
```
::

### Bonus Tip: Use an alias
Rather than typing `vendor/bin/spin` every time, you can add a "smart alias", which will check to see if it exists in your `node_modules`, if not, it loads it from the `vendor` folder.

You can add the following below to your `~/.bash_profile` or your `~/.zshrc`.

::code-panel
---
label: Add to your shell profile (recommended)
---
```bash
alias spin='[ -f node_modules/.bin/spin ] && bash node_modules/.bin/spin || bash vendor/bin/spin'
```
::

You'll now be able to access `spin` from your project root directory.

## Initialize Your Project
Once Spin is installed, you can follow the initialization wizard for your project by running `spin init`.

::code-panel
---
label: Initialize Spin with your project
---
```bash
spin init
```
