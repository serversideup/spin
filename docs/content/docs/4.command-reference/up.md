# spin up
::lead-p
Bring up all containers defined in `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.$SPIN_ENV.yml` (`$SPIN_ENV` defaults to `dev`).
::

## Usage
::code-panel
---
label: Usage for "spin up"
---
```bash
spin up [OPTIONS]
```
::

## Example
::code-panel
---
label: Force a build of containers on initialization
---
```bash
spin up --build
```
::

You can add options at the end of the command (like the `--build` shown above. The above command will bring up your containers, but then also force a new build (if you have builds configured in your "docker-compose.dev.yml" file).

## Defaults
The `spin up` command defaults to running:
::code-panel
---
label: Command default
---
```bash
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.dev.yml docker compose up
```
::

## Official Documentation & Additional Options

#### Spin Specific Options
- `--skip-pull`: Do not automatically pull docker images.
- `--force-pull`: Pull Docker Compose images, regardless of cache settings.

### Official Docker Options
This command is a shortcut for [`docker compose up`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/) and can accept additional options that you pass to it. It also does a number of other special things.


## Special notes
* Make sure to have a `docker-compose.yml` and **by default** a `docker-compose.dev.yml` in your project before running
* Spin will automatically pull image updates (only if the machine is connected to the Internet)
* Spin will remove any orphan containers

## Overriding the environment with `$SPIN_ENV`
Let's say you have a few different files in your repository:
::code-panel
---
label: Example project root
---
```
.
├── docker-compose.ci.yml
├── docker-compose.production.yml
├── docker-compose.staging.yml
├── docker-compose.testing.yml
└── docker-compose.yml
```
::


By default, Spin uses `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

If you want to change that, you just need to set `$SPIN_ENV`:
::code-panel
---
label: Change spin environment
---
```bash
SPIN_ENV=testing spin up
```
::


This will essentially run:

::code-panel
---
label: Above command will execute this below
---
```bash
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.testing.yml docker compose up
```
