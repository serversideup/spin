## Official Documentation & Additional Options
This command is a shortcut for [`docker system prune --all`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/) and can accept additional options that you pass to it. Spin defaults the `--all` for you already, so no need to add that.

If you want to clear volumes as well, you will need to add `--volumes` to the end of the command.
