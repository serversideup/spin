# spin exec
::lead-p
Use `exec` if you want to run a command in **currently running** containers.
::

## Usage
::code-panel
---
label: Usage for "spin exec"
---
```bash
spin exec [OPTIONS] SERVICE COMMAND
```
::

## Example
::code-panel
---
label: Example of running `php artisan migrate` within the `php` container
---
```bash
spin exec php php artisan migrate
```
::

The above command runs `php artisan migrate` inside of the `php` service (this is why "php" is repeated twice).

## Special notes
This will only run on machines that have `spin` installed on it. This means if you installed `spin` via "composer" or "yarn", this command will **not** execute.
