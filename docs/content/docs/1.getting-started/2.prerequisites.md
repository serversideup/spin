# Prerequisites
We intentionally wrote Spin to have little dependencies as possible. Everything is written in Bash, so it's ready to run on macOS, Windows (with WSL2), and Linux without any configuration to support running the scripts we provide.

There are a few assumptions that we have in regards to your environment:

## Local Development
- You must have a machine that has Docker installed (docker-ce or Docker Desktop)
- For any local development domains (example `myapp.dev.test`), you will need to add these entries to your local host

#### Host File Example
The hosts file is located at `/etc/hosts` for macOS and Linux. For Windows, it is located at `%WinDir%\System32\Drivers\Etc\Hosts`.

::code-panel
---
label: Edit this with `sudo nano /etc/hosts` on Mac/Linux or open as Administrator in Notepad on Windows
---
```bash
127.0.0.1 myapp.dev.test
127.0.0.1 otherapp.dev.test
127.0.0.1 myservice.dev.test
```
```spin up``` will use the alias defined in docker-compose.dev.yml L7 under traefik > aliases.

## CI/CD
**You do NOT need to install the Spin script itself in CI/CD**. You might find it easier to be explicit if you need to bring your services up in CI. For example:

::code-panel
---
label: Example of running the Spin structure in CI
---
```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:

env:
  DOCKER_COMPOSE_CMD: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ci.yml

jobs:
  php-unit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Bring up containers with Docker Compose
        run: |
          $DOCKER_COMPOSE_CMD \
          up -d -V --remove-orphans

      - name: Run PHP Unit Test
        run: |
          $DOCKER_COMPOSE_CMD \
          run \
          php \
          php ./vendor/bin/phpunit --log-junit report.xml
      
      - name: Bring down containers
        run: $DOCKER_COMPOSE_CMD down -v --remove-orphans
```

### GitHub Actions
If you're running GitHub Actions with our templates, you will need to ensure the following:

- Your GitHub Actions plan supports environments
- The environments are created and configured with secrets
- You have configured every secret in your GitHub actions workflow

If you're using our default GitHub Actions templates, this includes:
- `DEPLOYMENT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `DEPLOYMENT_SSH_HOSTNAME`
- `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`
- `DB_NAME`
- `DB_USERNAME`
- `DB_PASSWORD`
- `ENV_FILE_BASE64`

## Production, Staging, etc
Before you run [`spin provision`](/docs/command-reference/provision), the following must be completed:

- You have a running **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server** running on any host of your choice
- You have SSH access configured working between your computer and your server
- The SSH account has `sudo` access to perform root-level changes
- Your `.spin-inventory` is configured correctly (following [Ansible's standard inventory format](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html))
- Your `.spin.yml` is configured correctly
