# How Spin Works
::lead-p
Spin is a collection of proven open source technologies delivered to you in a simple and easy to use experience. This document explains what technologies it uses, how it works, and how this tool can enable you to have a lot of power and freedom to self-host and distribute your applications.

## What Spin uses
![Spin Diagram](/images/docs/whats-spin/spin-diagram.png)

At the core of Spin are:
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (used in local development)
- [Docker Swarm Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) (used in production, staging, etc.)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) (used to ensure your server is configured correctly)

### Other templates that we provide
Spin is designed with the entire development lifecycle in mind, so we do offer GitHub Actions templates when you run [`spin new`](/docs/command-reference/new) to create a project, or [`spin init`](/docs/command-reference/init).

## Why not just use these technologies directly?
Some users may have very advanced use cases and it may make sense for them to just use the technologies directly. But Spin is designed to reduce the learning curve for delivering containerized applications with Docker. This is where be believe the 99% of people are.

If you're running some massive server farm you may just want to consider writing your own tooling to match your unique use case. The good news is you **don't need to use Spin everywhere.** Spin is a *structure* just as much as it is a tool.

## Important concepts
Spin's flexibility comes from embracing the [Docker Compose Overrides (aka Docker Compose Extends)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/multiple-compose-files/extends/) structure.

## Spin Syntax
You'll notice that Spin follows the same syntax as the tool it's built on top of. For example, `spin up` runs `docker compose up` and supports any CLI
