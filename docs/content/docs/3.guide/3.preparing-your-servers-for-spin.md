# Preparing your server
::lead-p
Spin gives you the power to choose any host that you want. Although the responsibility is on your shoulders to get a server set up, Spin makes it very easy to get this accomplished.
::

## Choose a host
Choose any host that:
- Gives you root access to a system running **Ubuntu 22.04+**
- Allows root SSH access
- Has backup/snapshot services (highly recommended)
- It's usually best for you run this on a **brand new server** with a fresh installation

## Configure your DNS
Ensure that you have DNS configured to point your server hostname (optional, but highly recommended).

## Configure server inventory and settings
There are two files that will need to be configured:
- `.spin-inventory.ini`
- `.spin.yml`

#### Inventory
We call the list of our servers "inventory". This follows the [Ansible Inventory format](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html). For example, if you wanted to add `server01.example.com` as the production server, we would configure our file to look like this and add this server to go underneath the `production_manager_servers` group:

::code-panel
---
label: ".spin-inventory.ini: Add `server01.example.com` to Production"
---
```ini
####################
# Host Types
####################

[production_manager_servers]
server01.example.com

[staging_manager_servers]
# server02.example.com

####################
# Swarm Roles
####################
[swarm_managers:children]
production_manager_servers
staging_manager_servers

####################
# Environment
####################
[production:children]
production_manager_servers

[staging:children]
staging_manager_servers

[all_servers:children]
production
staging
```
::

## Configure other server settings
In the `.spin.yml` file, you will find many other settings. There are a few things that you will want to check here:

#### 👉 Required to be changed

| Key | Description |
|-----|---|
| `server_contact` | Change this to a valid email. **If you're using our Traefik templates**, you'll also need to change the `letsencryptresolver.acme.email` key under the `.infrastructure/conf/traefik/prod/traefik.yml` file. | 
| `docker_user.authorized_ssh_keys` | This must be the **public key** of the your [dedicated SSH keypair that you generated](/docs/guide/generating-a-secure-deployment-key).
| `users.username` | Set this to a username that you'll remember. Be sure to not use any weird characters. |
| `users.password` | Set this to the hash [generated with `mkpasswd`](/docs/guide/using-mkpasswd-to-generate-user-passwords). |
| `users.username.authorized_ssh_keys` | Set this to **your _public_ SSH key value**. ⚠️ The key pair must be accessible under `~/.ssh` on your host. |

### Use the template below to set users and their authorized keys
## Passwords must be set with an encrypted hash. To do this, see the Ansible FAQ.
## Your best bet is probably using the `mkpasswd` on a Linux machine.
## https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-generate-encrypted-passwords-for-the-user-module

users:
  - username: alice # 👈 Change this
    name: Alice Smith  # 👈 Change this
    state: present
    groups: ['adm','sudo']
    password: "$6$mysecretsalt$qJbapG68nyRab3gxvKWPUcs2g3t0oMHSHMnSKecYNpSi3CuZm.GbBqXO8BE6EI6P1JUefhA0qvD7b5LSh./PU1" # 👈 Change this

    authorized_keys:
      - public_key: "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lmyfakeublickeyMVIzwQXBzxxD9b8Erd1FKVvu alice" # 👈 Change this

## Run `spin provison`
Once you have `.spin.yml` and `.spin-inventory.ini` configure, you're ready to provision your server(s).

::code-panel
---
label: "Provision your server(s)"
---
```bash
spin provision
```
::

This process will automatically download [our Ansible collection](https://github.com/serversideup/ansible-collection-spin) and apply the changes on your server.

## Confirm everything works
To confirm everything works as expected, try to SSH into your server using the username you created before. You will be prompted to change your password to a new password as soon as you login.

::code-panel
---
label: "Provision your server(s)"
---
```bash
ssh -p 22 myuser@server01.example.com
```
::

If you get a connection, you should be ready to receive deployments to Docker Swarm via SSH 🥳
