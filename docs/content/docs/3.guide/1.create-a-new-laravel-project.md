# Create a new Laravel project
::lead-p
Getting up and running with a new Laravel project with Spin is easy. It's recommended to install Spin globally so you can easily create new projects. Follow the installation instructions for [macOS](/docs/installation/install-macos/), [Linux](/docs/installation/install-linux), or [Windows](/docs/installation/install-windows) before continuing.

## Spin New Laravel Project
We created a command called `spin new`, which will create a new Laravel project for you.

::code-panel
---
label: "Create a new Laravel project called \"spin-demo\""
---
```bash
spin new laravel spin-demo
```
::
This will create a project in your current directory called `spin-demo`. You can also specify a path to create the project in a different directory.
