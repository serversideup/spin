# Using "mkpasswd" to Generate Passwords

::lead-p
Ansible requires passwords to be set in a certain format. In this guide, you'll learn how to use Docker to create an Ubuntu 22.04 container on your local machine, install `mkpasswd`, then use `mkdpasswd` to generate the secure hashes you need.
::

## Create a temporary container
We'll use the power of Docker to run a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 instance. We'll install `mkpasswd` on it, then once we close the container, the container will automatically destroy itself.

::code-panel
---
label: "Run a temporary docker container"
---
```bash
docker run --rm -it ubuntu:22.04 bash
```
::

Once inside the container, run this command to install `mkpasswd`.

::code-panel
---
label: "Install `mkpasswd`"
---
```bash
apt -y update && apt -y install whois
```
::

Now that `mkpasswd` is installed, we can use the command to create a password hash.

::code-panel
---
label: "Use `mkpasswd` to generate a hash"
---
```bash
mkpasswd mysupersecretpassword
```
::

That should return a value similar to this:

::code-panel
---
label: "Example password hash"
---
```txt
$y$j9T$x/n10Dsflcgy34aO5SPq9fkyHH/ci8iUgQ1$64V3lskdc6jYhAfD/2SPIWFHV.B
```
::

You will want to use the generated password hash above to set in your [`.spin.yml` for `users.password`](/docs/guide/preparing-your-servers-for-spin#configure-other-server-settings).
