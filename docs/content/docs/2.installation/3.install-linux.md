## Pre-requisites
You must have a working installation of Docker.

### Install Docker Engine

::note
Docker will want you to install "Docker Desktop" on your Linux installation. This is completely unnecessary in our opinion. You can install it following the CLI installation (known as "Docker Engine") instead. 
::

Install "Docker Engine" following the official installation instructions:
- [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)
- [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) (NOT for Ubuntu. Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for Ubuntu)
- [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
- [RHEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/)
- [SLES](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/sles/)
- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Raspbian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/raspberry-pi-os/)
- [Binaries](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/)

### Configure Docker permissions
Using the [post-installation instructions defined by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/), be sure to add your current user to the `docker` group if you want to be able to run Docker without root privileges.

::code-panel
---
label: Create the `docker` group
---
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Add your current user to the `docker` group.
---
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Activate the changes to groups.
---
```bash
newgrp docker
```
::

### Ensure Docker is working
To test you have a working version of Docker, you can run their "hello world" container. `docker version`.

::code-panel
---
label: Run a "hello world" container to ensure Docker works correctly
---
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
::

## Download and install `spin`
Run the installer with this simple command in your terminal

::code-panel
---
label: Install spin (no root permissions required)
---
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/spin/main/tools/install.sh)"
```
::

The above script will install spin at the _user_ level in `~/.spin`, using less than 300KB of storage.

## Add `spin` to your PATH
In order for your terminal to know where `spin` is located, we need to add this to your "PATH" for your shell. Depending on your shell, you will need to **paste the following text at the BOTTOM of the appropriate file**:

::note
Run `echo $0` in your terminal to figure out which shell you are using.
::


::code-panel
---
label: Add spin to your path
---
```bash
# Add this to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`
export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"
```
::

Files to modify:
- **ZSH (most modern Macs):** ~/.zshrc
- **Bash:** ~/.bash_profile

You can use something like `nano` or `vim` to modify these files.

## Apply your changes
To apply the changes, simply restart your terminal or you can source the file you just modified:

::code-panel
---
label: Use the "source" command to apply your profile changes immediately
---
```bash
# If you're using ZSH
source ~/.zshrc

# If you're using Bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```
::

## Configure Docker Compose V2
Spin is set to run the latest version of Docker Compose. By default, Linux still ships with V1. You can follow Docker's official steps on [ How to Install Docker Compose V2 →](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#install-on-linux)

## Verify your user can run Docker commands
::note
Make sure your user has access to manage the Docker daemon.
::

::code-panel
---
label: Check you have permissions to access the `docker` command
---
```bash
docker compose version
```
::

### ❌ If you run into an error: Add your user to the Docker Group
If your user does not have access to the Docker Daemon, follow these steps:

::code-panel
---
label: Ensure the "docker" group is created
---
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Add your user to the "docker" group
---
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Activate changes to your group
---
```bash
newgrp docker
```
::

## Validate `spin` is working


::code-panel
---
label: Confirm spin is working correctly by getting the version
---
```bash
spin version
```
