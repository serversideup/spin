## What is Nuxt?
[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) is a framework built on top of Vue.js that simplifies the development of modern web applications by offering server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and single-page applications (SPAs). It features automatic routing, code splitting, and a modular architecture, making it easy to build performant and SEO-friendly websites with minimal configuration.

- **Nuxt**: The latest version of Nuxt.js
